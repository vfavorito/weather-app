# Weather App

### Overview:
In this repository I created a Weather Dashboard.  The Dashboard allows you to search for a city to add to the dashboard and saves that city to local storage.  When these cities are clicked a display of the current weather conditions is shown as well as a five day forecast.  This was primarily accomplished using Jquery, Ajax calls to openweather API, and Bootstrap.  

## How it works!
